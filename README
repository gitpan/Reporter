Data::Reporter module for Perl
----------------------

This module generates ascii reports from a Database or a plain ascii file.


Data::Reporter has a series of components. The user has only to define the 
contents or functions that each component will use or display. Some are 
mandatory (Header, Title, Detail) while others are optional to the user.
Here is the list of all the components:
	- Header
   - Title
   - Detail
   - Breaks
   - Final
   - Footer

Because of perl's multiple plataform availability, the same report program 
can be run in many platforms with no changes in the code. The modules have been tested on Solaris, Windows NT and Windows 95.

A visual report generator called VisRep.pl is also included. This is based
on PerlTk. This program generates perl programs, that can be executed. 
VisRep.pl can be later used to edit such generated programs.

Three examples are included:
avef5803.pl    Uses a plain ascii file ajusbena.rep as datasource.
               generates the BENAVIDES file
avef5803a.pl   The same program as avef5803.pl, but created with VisRep.pl
               generates the BENAVIDES file
avef5804.pl    Uses a Sybase datasource.
               This program has been created with VisRep.pl
               and generates the INVOICES file
